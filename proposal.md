# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Magic Snowball

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that predicts the likelihood of a snow day.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This site will use the parameters used by the Office of Emergency Management (Philadelphia) and user input 
(weather forecast).

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Able to predict the likelihood of a snow day.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The site will incorporate images, as well.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Ideally, I would LIKE to maybe take in live data in the program.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will outline what the program should, at minimum, do. Then, I will work on the parts of the program. I really 
want to learn how to make live data (NWS or NOAA) a part of a Python program.
